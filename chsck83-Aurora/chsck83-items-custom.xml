	<element name="Bag of Hefty Storage Capacity - Baggington" type="Magic Item" source="Dave's Brain" id="ID_CHSCK83_MAGIC_ITEM_BAG_OF_HEFTY_STORAGE_CAPACITY_BAGGINGTON">
		<description>
			<p>This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 8 feet in diameter at the mouth and 100 feet deep. No one knows the amout this bag can hold. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action if it's in the main area of the bag.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the bag is burned, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in a random plane. If the bag is turned inside out, nothing happens, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive.</p>
			<p class="indent">Placing a this bag inside an extradimensional space created by a <em>handy haversack</em>, <em>portable hole</em>, or similar item does nothing. </p>
